# Wax Puck Rack 

![A rendering of the 3D Model](images/Render.png)

My wax melter on my desk shapes its wax into little pucks. These pucks last a long time before needing to be swapped out. I often want to change scents before they go bad so I printed a rack to store still good scent pucks.

4 stacks of 5 pennies each help weigh the rack down. The print is paused halfway through and the pennies are inserted into the 4 holes shown above.
